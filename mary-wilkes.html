                    Her Life
                </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>In eighth grade, Mary Allen Wilkes had a geography teacher tell her that she ought to be a computer
                    programmer when she grew up. Little did they both know, Mary would not only become a programmer, but
                    she would eventually become known as the very first person to ever use what we now consider a “PC”
                    in her own living room.</p>
                <p>After she graduated from college, Mary had initially wanted to be a lawyer but was discouraged from
                    that path due to the field not being very friendly to women at the time. She thought about what her
                    teacher had once told her about being a programmer, so she had her parents drive her to MIT so she
                    could apply for a job. At the time, there was no coding test or experience necessary, only the
                    ability to think logically. Because Mary had studied logic and philosophy in college, she was easily
                    able to pass the test to become a programmer.</p>
                <p>After working on large, punch-card programmed computers for IBM, Mary was eventually assigned to work
                    on a new, smaller computer that had its own screen and keyboard. The LINC became her most well-known
                    project. It was the very first “minicomputer” - and the predecessor to what we consider personal
                    computers today. Mary went on to co-author the book, “Programming the LINC” with Wesley A. Clark.
                </p>
                <p>The next project Clark worked on after the LINC was to design “macromodules” which were computer
                    building blocks. Mary was the one to develop the multiply macromodule, which was the most complex of
                    the entire set.</p>
                <p>Mary has said that programming computers was intellectually stimulating but socially isolating, and
                    she really wanted to fulfill her childhood dream of becoming a litigator. After her amazing work as
                    a programmer and developer of many computer programming manuals, Mary Allen Wilkes attended Harvard
                    Law School and became a lawyer, and spent most of her working years practicing law.</p>
