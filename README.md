To celebrate International Women's Day, this month's Code Institute hackathon is paying tribute to Women in the Tech Industry. 

Out of the main challenges faced by women in tech on a daily basis, we decided to focus our project around the theme of 'Lack of Representation'. It is true that women are often under-represented in technical roles, and more specifically, there are women who are completely unheard of by a large percentage of the population. These women have pushed the boundaries of science, gone where no coder or computer scientist had ever gone before, and paved the way for future generations with ground-breaking innovations that no-one has ever heard about. 

We are celebrating the lives of amazing women who have changed the face of technology. Welcome to [Follow her Footsteps!](https://phloreenm.github.io/team4-march-hackathon/)

## Design, Layout & Structure

Having agreed on the topic of under-represented women, we decided to build a website dedicated to the lives and achievements of six important women in the tech industry. The homepage gives a summary of all six women, and there there is a detailed overview page of each woman's life and points of interest.

To take even further inspiration from these women, there is then a quiz page where you can answer a series of questions to find out who would be your ideal female tech role model to follow and aspire to out of the six women promoted on our site.

### **Wireframes**

We designed two wireframes for desktop at the start of the project. One for the main homepage, and a second one for the role model quiz. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

![Quiz Page](assets/images/readme/quiz-page.png)

### **Colour Scheme**

Originally we wanted to keep the color scheme very classic and simple using black and white images. Then to add a hint of color, we introduced some additional tones into the overall site color palette.

![Color Scheme](assets/images/readme/color-palette.png)

### **Fonts**

Using Google Fonts, we selected 'Merriweather Sans' for the Header font and 'Asap' for the body. These default to Sans Serif where not available.

## Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar contains a bespoke logo for the site on the left, which is also a link back to the homepage from any point across the site. On the right, the user can access the role model quiz, or each of the six role model's information pages. 

![Desktop View](assets/images/readme/navbar-d.png)

This navbar reduces down into a hamburger menu for tablet and mobile devices.

![Navbar mobile view - open](assets/images/readme/navbar-m-c.png)
![Navbar mobile view - open](assets/images/readme/navbar-m-o.png)

### Callout 

Filling the full view height of the page is an initial hero-image and our Callout text describing the website. There is also a direct link from the hero-image to start the quiz.

![Callout](assets/images/readme/callout.png)

### About

Below the callout is the About section describing the reasoning behind our website and its contents.

![About](assets/images/readme/about.png)

### Meet the Role Models

Below the About section is an introduction card about each of the six featured women on our site. You can see a black and white profile image, and summary about each person, and a link to click through to a more detailed summary of their life.

In desktop and tablet view, there are two cards displayed on each row. For mobiles, only one card is shown per row. 

![Role Models Introduction - desktop](assets/images/readme/rm-intros.png)
![Role Models Introduction - mobile](assets/images/readme/rm-intros-mobile.png)

### Footer

The footer contains ficticious social media links, and a link to the team's GitHub repository. The footer condenses down into two rows for mobile devices. 

![Footer - desktop](assets/images/readme/footer-desktop.png)
![Footer - mobile](assets/images/readme/footer-mobile.png)

### Role Models

There is a full page of information dedicated to each of the sox featured role models on our site. This is broken down into three sections:
* A profile picture
* A detailed story of her life
* A timeline of important events

![Profile Picture](assets/images/readme/rm-pic.png)
![Life Story](assets/images/readme/life.png)
![Timeline](assets/images/readme/journey.png)

### Role Model Quiz

You can answer a series of 10 questions to discover which female role model you are most suited to aspire to, and follow in their footsteps. 

![quiz Start Page](assets/images/readme/quiz-start.png)

For each of the quiz questions, you have to choose an answer that you feel most closely relates to your personal situation or feelings.

![quiz Start Page](assets/images/readme/quiz-questions.png)

As you go along, the site calculates which of the six role models you can relate to more closely. If, once you get to the end, you are similar to more than one role model, you must play the tie breaker round to narrow it down.

![quiz Start Page](assets/images/readme/quiz-tie.png)

Once you have answered all ten questions, and a possible tie-breaker, the site pairs you up with your ideal role model and gives you your results.

## Testing & Bugs

### HTML Validation

We ran the code for all the pages through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/).

#### **Errors**

There were some small initial errors occurring on multiple pages:

<details><summary>Home Page</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/testing_html_index_1.jpeg">
</details>

<details><summary>Quiz</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/testing_html_quiz_1.jpeg">
</details>

<details><summary>404</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/testing_html_404_1.jpeg">
</details>

<details><summary>Bio Pages</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/testing_html_ada_1.jpeg">
</details>

These included:
* A px unit included on the width of image elements - fixed by removing the px
* `<a>` element as the child of `<li>` elements - fixed by changing the structure of the HTML in the nav bar
* A missing `<li>` tag - fixed by adding it in
* A missing `</script>` closing tag - fixed by adding it in
* A missing `</div>` closing tag - fixed by adding it in
* A duplicate ID used on quiz.html - fixed by renaming the ID on one of the divs
* An empty `src` value on the quiz modal image (to be populated in the JavaScript based on results) - fixed by adding a placeholder image

### CSS Validation

We ran the CSS code through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). The CSS passed with no errors

#### **Errors**
<details><summary>CSS Validation Results</summary>

### JavaScript Validation

We ran the JavaScript code through [JSHint](https://jshint.com/). 

There were no errors but there were a number of warnings:

<details><summary>JSHint Results</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/testing_js.jpeg">
</details>

* Two undefined variables (these were declared in the questions and role model arrays in separate files) - no fix needed
* Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. This error referred the readability of the JavaScript code - due to the time constraints of the Hackathon and the fact that the code was working correctly and it was just a readability issue rather than an error this code was left as it was.

- - -

### Performance

We ran the site through Google Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse to check on its performance. All scores were 90 or above.

<details><summary>Home Page</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/testing_lh_index.jpeg">
</details>

<details><summary>Quiz</summary>

<details><summary>Bio Pages (all scored the same)</summary>

## Bugs & Fixes

During development and testing we encountered the following bugs:

#### **1: Layout issues index.html**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs_1_desktop.jpg">
<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs_1_mobile.gif">

</details>

In an early version of the layout for index.html there were multiple issues on index.html relating to the layout on desktop and mobile. These were all fixed by changing the HTML & CSS structure and resizing and optimising the images. The final results of the fix can be seen in the finished website images above.


#### **2: Button hover effect on quiz**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs_2_incorrect.gif">

*Hover Effects - functioning incorrectly*

<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs_2_correct.gif">

*Hover Effects - functioning correctly*

</details>

We discovered that in certain browsers/devices (in this case Windows & Chrome) the CSS hover effect on the game buttons and answers wasn't working correctly. We checked it on [responsivedesignchecker.com](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) and the hover effect was working correctly there. Due to the time restrainst of the hackathon this bug remains.
