        "Susan Wojcicki is an American tech industry executive who was CEO of YouTube from 2014-2023. Wojcicki's father was a physics professor at Stanford University, and her mother was a teacher. She grew up in the Stanford, California, area and later studied history and literature at Harvard, economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and business at the University of California, Los Angeles. After returning to Silicon Valley in 1998, she rented out garage space in her Menlo Park home to the newly incorporated Google Inc., which briefly used it as the company's first headquarters office.",
        "She became Google's first marketing manager in 1999, her first task was to find ways of generating revenue from the company's signature search engine. Her first big success came in 2000, with the debut of AdWords, the clickable text-only advertisements that appear on Google search pages. Wojcicki first became involved with video sharing in connection with the launch of Google Video in 2005. The following year she oversaw the purchase of rival YouTube. Wojcicki, who was elevated to senior vice president at Google in 2010, moved over to YouTube in 2014 and became the company's CEO later that year. She thus became head of an operation that claimed to have more than one billion monthly users."

        "Annie Easley was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and rocket scientist. She was one of the first African-Americans to work at NASA. In 1955, Easley began her career as a 'human computer', at the NACA (which would later become part of NASA), doing computations for researchers. This involved analysing problems and doing calculations by hand. She was one of only four African-American employees at the Lab at the time. In a 2001 interview she said that she had never set out to be a pioneer. 'I just have my own attitude. I'm out here to get the job done, and I knew I had the ability to do it, and that's where my focus was.'",
        "When human computers were replaced by machines, Easley evolved along with the technology. She developed and implemented code used in researching alternative power technology, including the battery technology that was used for early hybrid vehicles, as well as for the Centaur upper-stage rocket. In the 1970s, Easley returned to school to earn her degree in mathematics from Cleveland State, doing much of her coursework while also working full time. A firm believer in education and in her mother's advice 'You can be anything you want to be, but you have to work at it,' Easley was very dedicated in her outreach efforts at NASA, telling students about NASA's work and inspiring especially female and minority students to consider STEM careers. On February 1, 2021, a crater on the moon was named after Easley."
