        "Susan Wojcicki is an American tech industry executive who was CEO of YouTube from 2014-2023. Wojcicki's father was a physics professor at Stanford University, and her mother was a teacher. She grew up in the Stanford, California, area and later studied history and literature at Harvard, economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and business at the University of California, Los Angeles. After returning to Silicon Valley in 1998, she rented out garage space in her Menlo Park home to the newly incorporated Google Inc., which briefly used it as the company's first headquarters office.",
        "She became Google's first marketing manager in 1999, her first task was to find ways of generating revenue from the company's signature search engine. Her first big success came in 2000, with the debut of AdWords, the clickable text-only advertisements that appear on Google search pages. Wojcicki first became involved with video sharing in connection with the launch of Google Video in 2005. The following year she oversaw the purchase of rival YouTube. Wojcicki, who was elevated to senior vice president at Google in 2010, moved over to YouTube in 2014 and became the company's CEO later that year. She thus became head of an operation that claimed to have more than one billion monthly users."

        "Annie Easley was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and rocket scientist. She was one of the first African-Americans to work at NASA. In 1955, Easley began her career as a 'human computer', at the NACA (which would later become part of NASA), doing computations for researchers. This involved analysing problems and doing calculations by hand. She was one of only four African-American employees at the Lab at the time. In a 2001 interview she said that she had never set out to be a pioneer. 'I just have my own attitude. I'm out here to get the job done, and I knew I had the ability to do it, and that's where my focus was.'",
        "When human computers were replaced by machines, Easley evolved along with the technology. She developed and implemented code used in researching alternative power technology, including the battery technology that was used for early hybrid vehicles, as well as for the Centaur upper-stage rocket. In the 1970s, Easley returned to school to earn her degree in mathematics from Cleveland State, doing much of her coursework while also working full time. A firm believer in education and in her mother's advice 'You can be anything you want to be, but you have to work at it,' Easley was very dedicated in her outreach efforts at NASA, telling students about NASA's work and inspiring especially female and minority students to consider STEM careers. On February 1, 2021, a crater on the moon was named after Easley."

        "Nikki Durkin is an Australian entrepreneur who has made a significant impact in the tech industry through her innovative startups. She was born on December 19, 1991, and grew up in Sydney, where she attended the University of New South Wales, studying commerce and law. Durkin's entrepreneurial journey began in 2011 when she founded 99dresses, an online marketplace for trading clothing with virtual currency. Although the startup faced financial difficulties and eventually shut down in 2013, it was a testament to Durkin's ambition and innovation in the industry.",
        "Following the closure of 99dresses, Durkin founded Codemakers in 2014, which provided coding education and resources for children. Her goal was to teach children how to code and equip them with the necessary tools to become future leaders in the technology industry. Codemakers was later acquired by 3P Learning, an Australian edtech company, in 2017. Currently, Durkin is the founder and CEO of Parity, a startup that aims to help companies support gender equality in the workplace. The platform offers a range of benefits that address gender gaps and support women in the workplace. Durkin's entrepreneurial journey has been marked by her passion for technology and her commitment to making a difference. She has demonstrated that through hard work, determination, and innovation, anyone can create meaningful change in the world of tech."

    description: [
        "Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and inventor who pioneered the technology that would one day form the basis for today's WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth communication systems. An only child, Lamarr received a great deal of attention from her father, a bank director, who inspired her to look at the world with open eyes. He would often take her for long walks where he would discuss the inner-workings of machines, like the printing press or street cars. Meanwhile, Lamarr's mother introduced her to the arts, placing her in both ballet and piano lessons from a young age. Lamarr's brilliant mind was ignored, and her beauty took center stage when she was discovered by director Max Reinhardt at age 16 and became an actress. Howard Hughes helped to fuel the innovator in Lamarr. He took her to his airplane factories, showed her how the planes were built, and introduced her to the scientists behind process.",
        "Lamarr once said, 'Improving things comes naturally to me.' She went on to create an upgraded stoplight and a tablet that dissolved in water to make a soda similar to Coca-Cola. However, her most significant invention was engineered as the United States geared up to enter World War II. In 1940 Lamarr met George Antheil at a dinner party. The two came up with an extraordinary new communication system used with the intention of guiding torpedoes to their targets in war. The system involved the use of 'frequency hopping' amongst radio waves, with both transmitter and receiver hopping to new frequencies together. Doing so prevented the interception of the radio waves, thereby allowing the torpedo to find its intended target. The Electronic Frontier Foundation jointly awarded Lamarr and Antheil with their Pioneer Award in 1997. Lamarr also became the first woman to receive the Invention Convention's Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award. Although she died in 2000, Lamarr was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for the development of her frequency hopping technology in 2014. Such achievement has led Lamarr to be dubbed 'the mother of Wi-Fi' and other wireless communications like GPS and Bluetooth."
