    <h1>Annie Easley</h1>

    <p>Annie Easley was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and rocket scientist. She was one of the first
        African-Americans to work at NASA.</p>
    <p>In 1955, Easley began her career as a 'human computer', at the NACA (which would later become part of NASA),
        doing computations for researchers. This involved analysing problems and doing calculations by hand. She was one
        of only four African-American employees at the Lab at the time. In a 2001 interview she said that she had never
        set out to be a pioneer. "I just have my own attitude. I'm out here to get the job done, and I knew I had the
        ability to do it, and that's where my focus was."</p>
    <p>When human computers were replaced by machines, Easley evolved along with the technology. She developed and
        implemented code used in researching alternative power technology, including the battery technology that was
        used for early hybrid vehicles, as well as for the Centaur upper-stage rocket.</p>
    <p>In the 1970s, Easley returned to school to earn her degree in mathematics from Cleveland State, doing much of her
        coursework while also working full time.</p>
    <p>A firm believer in education and in her mother's advice "You can be anything you want to be, but you have to work
        at it", Easley was very dedicated in her outreach efforts at NASA, telling students about NASA's work and
        inspiring especially female and minority students to consider STEM careers.</p>
