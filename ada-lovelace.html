    <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
    <img src="assets/images/ada_lovelace.jpg" alt="Image of Ada Lovelace.jpg">
    <p>Ada Lovelace was born as Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815. She was the only legitimate child of the famous
        poet Lord George Gordon Byron. Lord Byron's marriage to Lovelace's mother, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron,
        was not a happy one and Lady Byron separated from her husband only weeks after their daughter was born.</p>
    <p>Lovelace's mother insisted that she be taught logic, science and mathematics from a young age - which was rare
        for women at the time. Ada Lovelace grew up to become a leading 19th century mathematician and an associate of
        Charles Babbage, for whose prototype of a digital computer she created a program.</p>
    <p>Through Babbage, Lovelace began studying advanced mathematics with University of London professor Augustus de
        Morgan. She tried to develop mathematical schemes for winning at gambling. Unfortunately, her schemes failed and
        put her in financial peril.</p>
    <p>She is chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the
        Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and
        published the first algorithm intended to be processed by such a machine.</p>
